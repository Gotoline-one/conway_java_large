actor "User" as user

  component "ConwayApplication" as CA
  component "ConwayAppController" as CCC
  component "ConwayAppView" as CAV
  component "GameOfLife Engine" as GOF
  component "Shutdown Hook" as SH

' --- User Interaction and Main Simulation Flow ---
user --> CAV : Interacts via JavaFX GUI
CAV --> CCC : Propagates user events (start, stop, reset)
CCC --> GOF : Commands simulation updates
GOF --> CAV : Feeds board state for real-time visualization
SH --> GOF : Triggers state saving on exit (JSON/CSV)

' --- Networking Flow (Optional Modes) ---
note right of SS : In server mode, the simulation \n periodically sends board data.
SS --> APS : Uses UDP to package & send data
note right of SR : In client mode, a separate thread \n continuously listens for board data.
SR --> AC : Receives UDP packets
AC --> GOF : Updates the simulation board with network data
